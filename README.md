## WSS_UQ
Uncertainty Quantification on gjackland's Weight-Scale-Shift (WSS) model for Covid epidemic modelling

# Background on model
The WSS model takes current real-world case data and (among other things) predicts current R number (often days/weeks before other R_no predictions which are based on hosp./deaths), hospitalisations and deaths.

# Uncertainty Quantification

# Framework for UQ with WSS model
